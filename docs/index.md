# Welcome to BioStatRx 

Hi, I’m Rahul.

I’m building **BioStatRx** to make biostatistics feel clearer and more usable—through practical notes, real examples, and hands-on code in **R** and **Python**. If you’re working with health data (or learning to), I hope this becomes a helpful place to return to.

## A bit about me

I’m originally from **India** and currently based in the **United Kingdom**.

In 2020, I founded [**StatisticaHub**](https://www.myacademictutor.com), an e-tutoring platform where I’ve mentored **500+ international students** across mathematics and statistics courses (2020–2025). Teaching has shaped how I explain things: simple language, clean intuition, and focus on what actually works.

## Education

- **BSc (Statistics)** — University of Delhi, India  
- **MSc (Statistics)** — IIT Kanpur, India  
- **MSc (Medical Statistics & Health Data Science)** — University of Bristol, UK  

## Open to collaboration

I’m happy to collaborate on projects in:

- **Biostatistics & medical statistics**
- **Regression modeling** (linear/logistic/Poisson/negative binomial)
- **Survival analysis** (Cox, time-dependent covariates, competing risks, frailty, recurrent events)
- **Clinical research analytics** + reproducible workflows
- **Education content** for health data science

If you’d like to work together, feel free to reach out.
