# Probability & Statistics Review

This section is a focused refresher on the **probability and statistics foundations** you’ll use throughout biostatistics, clinical trials, machine learning, regression, and survival analysis.

The goal is not to be overly theoretical—it's to build **intuition** so you can:
- read formulas in papers confidently,
- understand why methods work

---

## What you will learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Use the language of probability correctly: **sample spaces, events, independence**
- Work comfortably with **random variables** (discrete and continuous)
- Compute and interpret:
  - **expectation**, **variance**, **covariance**
  - **conditional expectation**
- Recognize and use common distributions in biostatistics:
  - Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson
  - Uniform, Normal, Exponential
- Understand how distributions connect to real data problems:
  - counts, rates, measurement error, waiting times
- Use core statistical summaries and functions:
  - mean/median/mode
  - variance/SD/IQR
  - correlation and covariance
- Build a strong base for later topics:
  - regression (linear/logistic/Poisson)
  - survival analysis (hazard intuition)
  - Bayesian methods (priors/likelihood)
  - inference concepts (sampling variability)

## Who this module is for

This section is ideal if you:
- want a quick but clear refresh before starting regression/survival/ML,
- feel shaky on distributions or expectation/variance

You’ll get the most benefit if you already know basic algebra.

## Module roadmap

This review is organized into five short chapters:

1. **Probability Basics**  
   Experiments, sample spaces, events, probability rules, and worked examples.

2. **Random Variables**  
   Discrete vs continuous random variables, PMF/PDF/CDF, and simulation intuition.

3. **Expectation & Variance**  
   Means, variances, standard deviation, and why these summaries matter in modeling.

4. **Probability Distributions**  
   Key distributions used constantly in biostatistics (Binomial/Poisson/Normal/etc.) and when to use them.

5. **Statistical Functions & Summaries**  
   Descriptive statistics, variability measures, correlation/covariance, and practical data summaries.
